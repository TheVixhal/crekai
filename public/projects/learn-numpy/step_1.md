# Step 1: Introduction to NumPy

Welcome to the NumPy fundamentals course! NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

## What is NumPy?

NumPy stands for "Numerical Python" and provides support for:
- Arrays and matrices
- Mathematical and statistical functions
- Linear algebra operations
- Fourier transforms

## Installation

Install NumPy using pip:

```python
pip install numpy
```

## Your First Array

Create your first NumPy array:

\`\`\`python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
\`\`\`

## Task

Create a NumPy array with numbers 1 to 10 and print it. Run the code in your Python environment.

**Expected output:**
\`\`\`
[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]
\`\`\`

# Step 6: Advanced Techniques and Best Practices

Learn professional techniques used in production neural networks.

## Topics

- Weight initialization strategies
- Batch normalization implementation
- Gradient clipping
- Early stopping
- Cross-validation

## Key Concepts

### Batch Normalization
Normalize layer inputs for faster training and better convergence.

### Gradient Clipping
Prevent exploding gradients by capping gradient values.

### Early Stopping
Stop training when validation performance stops improving.
